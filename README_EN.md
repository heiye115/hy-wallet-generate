# HY Web3 Wallet Generator

A Java-based multi-chain (BTC, ETH, TRON, Solana) wallet generation and validation tool.
Supports **high-strength random number generation**, **batch generation**, and recovery via **12-word mnemonic phrases (BIP39)**. It also outputs strict validation reports (including Ethereum EIP-55 checksum, address, and private key format checks).

## 1. Introduction

- **Name**: HY Web3 Wallet Generator (hy-wallet-generate)
- **Core Features**:
  - **Multi-Chain Support**: One-click generation of BTC (Legacy/SegWit), ETH, SOL, and TRON addresses and private keys.
  - **Batch Generation**: Supports generating a specified number of wallets in batch, suitable for development testing or large-scale address generation.
  - **Mnemonic Recovery**: Supports importing BIP39 standard 12-word mnemonics to deterministically derive all chain addresses.
  - **Security Validation**: Built-in `Validator` module performs strict checks (regex, checksum, length, etc.) on every generated address and private key to ensure usability.
- **Technical Highlights**:
  - **True Random Source**: Uses `java.security.SecureRandom` under the hood to ensure private key entropy security.
  - **Standard Compliance**:
    - **BTC**: BIP32/BIP44/BIP84 (P2PKH & Bech32)
    - **ETH**: BIP44 (m/44'/60'...) + EIP-55 Mixed-case Checksum
    - **SOL**: SLIP-0010 (Ed25519 Hardened)
    - **TRON**: Keccak-256 + Double SHA256 Checksum
- **Tech Stack**: JDK 21, Maven, bitcoinj, web3j, BouncyCastle

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Prerequisites

1. **JDK 21+**: Ensure `java -version` outputs 21 or higher.
2. **Build Project**:
   ```bash
   mvn -q -DskipTests package
   ```
   After building, the executable file will be located at `target/hy-wallet-generate.jar`.

### 2.2 Running the Tool

```bash
java -jar target/hy-wallet-generate.jar
```

**Interactive Menu**:
1. **Generate 1 Wallet**: Prints mnemonic, chain addresses/private keys, and **validation report** directly to the screen.
2. **Batch Generate Wallets**: Input quantity (e.g., 100) to quickly generate in batch.
3. **Generate from Mnemonic**: Input existing 12 mnemonic words (space-separated) to recover corresponding multi-chain addresses.

### 2.3 Private Key Formats

| Chain | Address Format | Private Key Format | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BTC** | Legacy (1...) <br> SegWit (bc1...) | WIF (Wallet Import Format) | Standard format, supported by most wallets for import |
| **ETH** | Starts with 0x, 40 chars | Hex (Starts with 0x, 64 chars) | Standard private key format |
| **TRON** | Starts with T, Base58 | Hex (Starts with 0x, 64 chars) | Compatible with TronLink import |
| **SOL** | Base58 | Base58 (64 bytes: 32 priv + 32 pub) | Compatible with Phantom/Solflare import |

## 3. Security & Notices (IMPORTANT)

### 3.1 Security Best Practices
- **⚠️ Offline Execution**: When generating wallets for real assets, please ensure you run this tool on an **offline** device.
- **⚠️ Mnemonic Storage**: The mnemonic phrase controls assets on all chains. Please write it down on paper and store it physically. **NEVER screenshot or copy it to an online device.**
- **Entropy Security**: This tool uses the operating system's strong random source (`/dev/random` or equivalent), ensuring unpredictability at the algorithmic level.

### 3.2 Validation Report
After generating a wallet (in single mode), the program automatically runs the `Validator` module and outputs the following checks:
- `[Mnemonic]`: Checks word count and compliance with the BIP39 wordlist.
- `[ETH]`: Checks compliance with EIP-55 mixed-case checksum standard.
- `[BTC]`: Validates the correspondence between address format and WIF private key.
- `[SOL/TRON]`: Validates Base58 encoding and private key length.

## 4. FAQ

- **Q: Why do generated ETH addresses have mixed case?**
  - A: This is the EIP-55 standard, used to prevent address input errors. Addresses generated by this tool carry the checksum by default.
- **Q: Failed to import Solana private key into wallet?**
  - A: This tool outputs the 64-byte (Secret Key + Public Key) Base58 encoded format, which is the Solana standard. If import fails, please check for extra spaces.
- **Q: Can I run this on Java 8?**
  - A: **No**. The project uses features from Java 21 (such as `record` and new `switch` syntax) and must be run with JDK 21+.
